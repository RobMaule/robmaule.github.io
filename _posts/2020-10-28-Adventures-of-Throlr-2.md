title: Adventures of Throlr - Part 2
published: true
---

The continuation of my solo play using Bivius.  I also decided to use Dungeon Architect Cards, as I wanted something to generate the rooms of the dungeon, as well as give helpful descriptor words.  I pulled out my GameMaster's Apprentice deck, as well, to add some variety to the choices.

The [Dungeon Architect Cards](https://www.kickstarter.com/projects/305572273/dac-dungeon-architect-cards/description){:target="_blank"} are by Simian Circle games, from a Kickstarter.  The [GameMaster's Apprentice](https://www.drivethrucards.com/product/125685/The-GameMasters-Apprentice-Base-Deck){:target="_blank"} deck is by Larcenous Designs.

Part 1 can be read [here](/Adventures-of-Throlr/).

Continuing the playthrough:

As Throlr peers down the dark depths below, he is tempted to turn away and head down the forest path, but he remembers that the map was leading him toward someone that needed his help.  He could not turn away from doing the right thing and helping someone.  He briefly took out the parchment to read it again, as best he could.  "Prisoner" was a word that meant something to him.

<div class="bluebox">
Who was a prisoner?<br/>
A) Himself or B) His Sister - B
</div>

Tholr's sister was taken from their family home in a raid and imprisoned for three years before he could rescue her.  The thought that someone else's sister could need rescue steeled his resolve.  The barbarian tightly gripped the torch and proceeded downward until he reached the room below.

<div class="bluebox">
Dungeon Architect Cards: Round Room
</div>

The stairs spiraled down into a round, stone floor room.  Blood stained parts of the floor, tattered cloth strewn about, and fungus grew up the walls.  There were two hallways on either side and one straight across.  Throlr looked into the blackness, but could not see which path might take him closer to the prisoner.  He strains his ears to possibly give him a clue.

<div class="bluebox">
Does he hear anything?<br/>
A) Yes or B) No - A
</div>

He does hear the sound of people talking.

<div class="bluebox">
But which way?<br/>
GameMaster's Apprentice (d6): 2<br/>
Left: 1-2 <br/>
Straight: 3-4<br/>
Right: 5-6
</div>

The noise seems to be coming from off to the left.  The hero cautiously creeps forward through the hallway until he reaches a door and slowly opens it.

<div class="bluebox">
Is there something noticeable on the other side?<br/>
GMA (unlikely): No<br/>
<br/>
Dungeon Architect Cards: 5x5 Room
</div>

There doesn't seem to be anyone in this next room.  Again, there are three other exits.  The bloodstains seem to come into this room from where he came.  A torture device sits in the middle of the room.

<div class="bluebox">
<a href="https://theloveforhistory.wordpress.com/other/10-medieval-torture-devices/" target="_blank">Google Search for Torture Devices</a><br/>
GMA (d10): 3
</div>

Throlr knows this to be called The Scavenger's Daughter.  A hideous device that wraps around a person crouching, with a hinge.  The screw would be turned to gradually squeeze the life out of a person, but not after breaking their ribs and spine.  He shivers at the thought of it being used on someone.  Thankfully, there's no one in it now.  And hopefully no one ever again.  Throlr looks for clues as to his next step, but isn't very observant, being a nomadic barbarian.

<div class="bluebox">
Round 1 (High vs Low): A<br/>
A) He finds nothing.<br/>
B) He thinks he finds something.<br/>
<br/>
GMA (Scatter Die, until I found one pointing to a door): straight
</div>

He scowls, as he can't find out which way to go.  It's time to just pick a direction and kick the door down.  The warrior grits his teeth and charges straight ahead, barreling across the room and at the last moment leaps and kicks against the wooden door.

<div class="bluebox">
Is there anything beyond?<br/>
GMA (unlikely odds): Yes<br/>
<br/>
Is it the prisoner?<br/>
GMA (even odds): YES!<br/>
<br/>
Dungeon Architect Cards: Odd Room<br/>
<br/>
Zero Dice: <a href="http://tangent-zero.com/zero_dice/zero_dice.htm?&pic1=1422.png&pic2=0609.png" target="_blank">Orcs</a>
</div>

Splinters fly into the oddly shaped hexagonal room and Throlr flies after them, landing on his leather sandaled feet and dropping his torch.  Torches flicker on the side walls.  With a quick battle sense, he spies two orcs near the middle of the room and draws The Untamed.  Behind them, he spies the prisoner he seeks, chained to the back wall.  But he doesn't have time to think about that now.  There is a fight to be had, and his enemies have been caught by surprise.

<div class="bluebox">
Round 1 (High vs High): B<br/>
A) Throlr slays 1 orc.<br/>
B) Throlr is pushed back in battle.
</div>

Throlr swings the blade across to meet the closest orc, but the green-skinned beast just narrowly dodges.  Only a fine line of blood is drawn.  He's now lost his advantage, and the pig snouted captors quickly scramble to meet him.  The defending orc carries a sword, and he and the barbarian trade swings, meeting steel against steel.  The other orc, carrying an axe, starts to advance.

<div class="bluebox">
Round 2: B<br/>
A) Throlr finally kills an orc.<br/>
B) The orcs gang up on Throlr and wound him.
</div>

Now that two strong enemies are fighting together against the hero, they have the advantage.  The orc axe swings downward toward Throlr's skull, but is parried at the last moment.  Then the sword, slashes in and does indeed catch the muscled fighter in the side.  Throlr grunts, not wanting to show his pain, but it is severe.  He doubles over and falls to the floor, his two-handed sword clattering next to him.  His vision starts to blur, but he can make out the orcs unchaining their captive and dragging her out the damaged door to the torture room.

Throlr is barely aware of what is going on, but he manages to reach into the pouch at his waist and grab ahold of his totem.

<div class="bluebox">
What is his totem?<br/>
A) Lion for strength or B) Snake for healing - B
</div>

His fingers find the snakeskin and he grips it tightly, his lips silently moving, chanting.  Suddenly, what was just a tattoo of a snake on his back starts to glow brightly.  The inked serpent lends it mystical energies to the steadfast warrior, mending the wound and bringing clarity back to his mind.  Drawing upon the totem and the tattoo will take its toll on him, but for now he is rejuvenated.  Throlr stands, picking up The Untamed.  The sword sports the thin line of blood from his first attack on the orcs.  It too, gives Throlr strength.  He starts walking to follow the orcs and prisoner.  The fighting is not yet finished.
